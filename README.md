Linear Regression(Without Using Sci-kit Library)
This repo is based on predicting the result based on training the model using Linear Regression.
Since the data set is big so it is not good to use Simple Linear Gradient Descent Algorithm.
So, here we use the Minibatch Approximation Method to train our model.
Since this data contains only one feature so after training the model we will get intercept and slope.
Intercept is represented by theta[0] and Slope is represented by theta[1].
We first read the files by using the pandas library.
Then the training dataset is normalized.
Then different functions have been created with their purpose described in the comments itself.
Using this method we can predict the output to a decent accuracy if not fully accurate.
